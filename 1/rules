Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on
To find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found.

Calculate a total similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list.
